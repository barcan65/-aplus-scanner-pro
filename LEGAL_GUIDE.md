## What to Ask Your Attorney

**Initial Consultation Questions:**

1. "I'm building a stock screening tool. Do I need SEC or FINRA registration?"
   - Most screening tools don't, but verify
   
2. "What disclaimers do I need?"
   - They'll review your Terms of Service and suggest changes

3. "What state should I incorporate in?"
   - Matters for liability protection and tax

4. "Do I need professional liability insurance?"
   - Recommended ($500-$1,500/yr)

5. "What about Polygon.io's terms—any conflicts?"
   - They'll review your API usage

## What Happens Without Legal Review?

**Risks:**
- ❌ SEC enforcement (fines, cease-and-desist)
- ❌ Lawsuit from user claiming "bad advice"
- ❌ Payment processor (Stripe) shutting you down
- ❌ Personal liability (no LLC protection)

**Probability:** Low (unless you scale), but not zero.
